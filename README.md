This Android application is designed to provide users with relevant transportation information through the use of affordable, small mobile devices that have limited computational resources, such as PDAs and smartphones. By utilizing common low-cost computing and telecommunications hardware, bus agencies and transportation authorities are able to support the infrastructure necessary for this application.
The Transport Tracking System, which relies on Wi-Fi technology, is capable of providing bus schedules, timing, and routing information to students of UMSIT who are in the vicinity of a Transport Tracking System Smart Bus Stop (SBS), which serves as a hotspot and information-gathering terminal node. PDA and smartphone users can freely access the Transport Tracking System service to obtain information about bus stops, including the arrival times of the next buses for a given destination or route, routing to various locations, and time-of-travel estimations. The hand-over of mobile device control is handled by a unique or specific protocol.
This information is periodically transmitted back to the bus stops, allowing users and students to obtain relevant information through a proposed method.

Project Objective:

The purpose of this project is to address the major problems faced by UMSIT students in utilizing their activities in the university and residential areas according to bus timings and routes. Currently, students waste valuable time due to the lack of accurate information. Our team intends to tackle these issues by implementing a Transport Tracking System through an android application. This system will provide UMSIT students with routing information, timing, and identification of buses through maps or other means. By doing so, students will be able to save time and have easy access to necessary information.

Currently, there is no existing Transport Tracking System in UMSIT. The information available to students is dispersed across different sources, making it cumbersome and time-consuming to retrieve incomplete information. Our goal is to upgrade the system and computerize it to allow for better control. Additionally, the system will provide real-time navigation on a map, allowing users to retrieve information efficiently and quickly.
